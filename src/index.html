                    <p>
                        This interactive simulator lets you design, build, and test electric circuit&mdash;like structures
                        from the popular video game <em>Minecraft</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have not played Minecraft before, or are unfamiliar with how redstone works, I recommend you
                        read the section at the bottom titled "What is Redstone?" first. Then, check the controls and
                        examples sections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system of redstone can be somewhat confusing at times. While it is possible to learn it
                        only by reading this tutorial, if you are interested in it, you might be better off watching a
                        few YouTube videos first.

                        <li>
                            You can move around by using the <strong>WASD</strong> and <strong>QE keys</strong>, and
                            rotate the camera with the <strong>arrow keys</strong>.
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                The location that you're currently looking at is highlighted in yellow.
                                Pressing <strong>Space</strong> will either remove the block at that location, or
                                place a block when the location is empty.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The yellow toolbar on the bottom shows which block you are going to place.
                            You can change which one you have currently selected by pressing the <strong>1&ndash;4 keys</strong>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 data-scroll-marker="blocks">Blocks</h2>
                    <p>
                        This simulator implements a few of the blocks that can be used to build redstone circuits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note that this section is intended as reference for people who already know the redstone
                        system. As such, it is much longer and more detailed than the other sections.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Cube:</strong> The standard cube block;
                                can be selected via <strong>1</strong> on the keyboard. Cubes can be used to build structures, or serve as scaffolding for other blocks.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Redstone wire:</strong> Used to transport signals from one place to another;
                                can be selected via <strong>2</strong> on the keyboard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A block of wire connects to adjacent wires and can thus be used to transport a signal from
                                one location to another. (Wire cannot travel diagonally.) By placing wire laterally adjacent
                                but one block higher or lower, you can build "stairs" that let signals travel up or down.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Redstone wire must be mounted on top of a solid surface to be placed &mdash; i.e. it must
                                be on a cube or a slab.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An individual block of wire is either unpowered and appears very dark red (its usual state),
                                or is powered by an adjacent powered block and appears appear red.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The power in a length of wire will fall off over distance, and weaker-powered wire will
                                appear darker. After 15 blocks, the power will fade out completely.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Slab:</strong> a "half-cube";
                                can be selected via <strong>3</strong> on the keyboard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Slabs fulfill most of the same functions as cubes, but have some slight differences.
                                Slabs cannot be powered (in the sense that a cube is).
                                First, Redstone torches can only be mounted on the top side of a slab.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Second, when
                                redstone wire is placed on "stairs" made of slabs, the wire will not visually connect
                                and power will only be able to travel in the "downwards" direction of the stairs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, slabs cannot be used to "pinch" stairs of redstone wire.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Redstone torch:</strong> a toggleable power source;
                                can be selected via <strong>4</strong> on the keyboard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Redstone torches must be mounted on a solid surface; in practice this means
                                that you can only place torches on the top or sides of a cube, or the top of
                                a slab. (Torches can't be placed on a downwards-facing surface.)
                            <p>
                                Redstone torches can be either lit ("on") or unlit ("off"). Lit torches will provide
                                power to any adjacent blocks, such as wires.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, a lit torch will strongly power any cube block directly above it, meaning
                                that wires placed on that cube will also be powered.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whether a torch is turned on or not depends on whether the block it is mounted on
                                is <em>weakly powered</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A cube, the most common mounting block for torches, is weakly powered when either there
                                is a lit torch directly underneath it, or there is a powered wire whose shape is pointing
                                into the cube. 

                                (Slabs cannot be weakly powered, which effectively means that a torch mounted on a slab
                                can never be turned off.)
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 data-scroll-marker="what">What is Redstone?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Redstone is a group of fictional devices from the popular video game <em>Minecraft</em>. It
                        serves as a loose analogue of electricity and can be used to create simple devices like
                        light switches to more complicated things like combination locks or automated factories and
                        machines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although each individual "redstone device" is simple, when combined they can become (to some extent)
                        nearly as versatile
                        as real-life electronic circuits. Players have even been able to create fully-functional &mdash;
                        albeit simple &mdash; computers running inside of Minecraft!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This simulator lets you experiment with several redstone devices and create simple circuits in your
                        web browser.
                        It doesn't have every single tool and feature as the "real" Minecraft, but you can still use it to
                        quickly try your ideas at any time.
