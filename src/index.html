                    <h2 id="scroll--what">What is Redstone?</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Redstone" is a fictional analogue of electricity that comes from the
                        video game <em>Minecraft</em>. Players can use redstone to create their own
                        virtual inventions that range from combination locks or music boxes or even simple
                        computers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Players do this by combining various "blocks", such as levers or pieces of wire.
                        Each block has its own particular function that it is useful for. When placed together
                        in the right way, the blocks interact with one another and can be used to create complex
                        devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This simulator implements some of the blocks from Minecraft, so that you can design and
                        experiment with your own redstone circuits.

                                <strong>Cube:</strong> The standard cube block;
                                can be selected with <span class="keybind">1</span>. Cubes can be used to build structures, or serve as scaffolding for other blocks.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                <strong>Redstone wire:</strong> Used to transport signals from one place to another;
                                can be selected with <span class="keybind">2</span>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wires connect with each other and can be used to transport signals from one place to
                                another. They can also climb up "stairs".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Redstone wire can only be placed on a solid surface &mdash; meaning you have to put a
                                cube or slab down before laying your wire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An individual block of wire is either unpowered and appears very dark red (its usual state),
                                or is powered by an adjacent powered block and appears appear red.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The power in a length of wire will fall off over distance, and weaker-powered wire will
                                appear darker. After 15 blocks, the power will fade out completely.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Slab:</strong> a "half-cube";
                                can be selected with <span class="keybind">3</span>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Slabs fulfill most of the same functions as cubes, but have some slight differences.
                                Slabs cannot be powered (in the sense that a cube is).
                                First, Redstone torches can only be mounted on the top side of a slab.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Second, when
                                redstone wire is placed on "stairs" made of slabs, the wire will not visually connect
                                and power will only be able to travel in the "downwards" direction of the stairs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, slabs cannot be used to "pinch" stairs of redstone wire.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Redstone torch:</strong> a toggleable power source;
                                can be selected with <span class="keybind">4</span>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Redstone torches must be mounted on a solid surface; in practice this means
                                that you can only place torches on the top or sides of a cube, or the top of
                                a slab. (Torches can't be placed on a downwards-facing surface.)
                            <p>
                                Redstone torches can be either lit ("on") or unlit ("off"). Lit torches will provide
                                power to any adjacent blocks, such as wires.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, a lit torch will strongly power any cube block directly above it, meaning
                                that wires placed on that cube will also be powered.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whether a torch is turned on or not depends on whether the block it is mounted on
                                is <em>weakly powered</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A cube, the most common mounting block for torches, is weakly powered when either there
                                is a lit torch directly underneath it, or there is a powered wire whose shape is pointing
                                into the cube. 

                                (Slabs cannot be weakly powered, which effectively means that a torch mounted on a slab
                                can never be turned off.)
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                                If redstone dust is configured in a plus shape, you can press
                                <span class="keybind">X</span> and it will change to a dot.
                                The difference is that while plus-shaped dust provides power to all adjacent blocks
                                (except above), dot-shaped dust will only provide
                                weak power to the block below it.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                You can also rotate the camera using <span class="keybind">Shift</span> +
                                <span class="keybind">A/D</span>.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Pressing <span class="keybind">Z</span> will toggle semi-transparent and opaque display.
                                (If you can't tell what this is doing, try rotating the camera)
                            </p>
