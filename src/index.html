                    <p>
                        Redstone is a group of fictional devices from the popular video game <em>Minecraft</em>. It
                        serves as a loose analogue of electricity and can be used to create simple devices like
                        light switches to more complicated things like combination locks or automated factories and
                        machines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although each individual "redstone device" is simple, when combined they can become (to some extent)
                        nearly as versatile
                        as real-life electronic circuits. Players have even been able to create fully-functional &mdash;
                        albeit simple &mdash; computers running inside of Minecraft!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This simulator lets you experiment with several redstone devices and create simple circuits in your
                        web browser.
                        It doesn't have every single tool and feature as the "real" Minecraft, but you can still use it to
                        quickly try your ideas at any time.

                        <li>
                            You can move around by using the <strong>WASD</strong> and <strong>QE keys</strong>, and
                            rotate the camera with the <strong>arrow keys</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The location that you're currently looking at is highlighted in yellow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pressing <strong>Space</strong> will either remove the block at that location, or
                                place a block when the location is empty.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can change the block that will be placed by pressing the <strong>1&ndash;4 keys</strong>.
                            The yellow toolbar on the bottom shows which block that is currently selected.
