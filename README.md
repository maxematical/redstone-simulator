# Redstone Simulator

Interactive WebGL application that lets you design, build, and test electric circuit-like structures
from the popular video game _Minecraft_.

## What is Redstone

"Redstone" is a fictional analogue of electricity that comes from the
video game _Minecraft_. Players can use redstone to create their own
virtual inventions that range from combination locks or music boxes or even simple
computers.

Players do this by combining various "blocks", such as levers or pieces of wire.
Each block has its own particular function that it is useful for. When placed together
in the right way, the blocks interact with one another and can be used to create complex
devices.

This simulator implements some of the blocks from Minecraft, so that you can design and
experiment with your own redstone circuits.
